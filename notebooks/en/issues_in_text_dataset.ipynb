    "In this 5-minute quickstart tutorial, we use Cleanlab to detect various issues in an intent classification dataset composed of (text) customer service requests at an online bank. We consider a subset of the [Banking77-OOS Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04564) containing 1,000 customer service requests which are classified into 10 categories based on their intent (you can run this same code on any text classification dataset). [Cleanlab](https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab) automatically identifies bad examples in our dataset, including mislabeled data, out-of-scope examples (outliers), or otherwise ambiguous examples. Consider filtering or correcting such bad examplesÂ before you dive deep into modeling your data!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview of what we'll do in this tutorial:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a pretrained transformer model to extract the text embeddings from the customer service requests\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train a simple Logistic Regression model on the text embeddings to compute out-of-sample predicted probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run Cleanlab's `Datalab` audit with these predictions and embeddings in order to identify problems like: label issues, outliers, and near duplicates in the dataset."

The overall non-iid score for the dataset (displayed below) corresponds to the `p-value` of a statistical test for whether the ordering of samples in the dataset appears related to the similarity between their feature values.

This may be benign if we remember to shuffle rows before model training and data splitting. But if you don't know why your data was flagged as non-IID, then you should be worried about potential data drift or unexpected interactions between data points (their values may not be statistically independent). Think carefully about what future test data may look like (and whether your data is representative of the population you care about). You should not shuffle your data before the non-IID test runs (will invalidate its conclusions)."
